# MyString
Recreation of the string class and its functions in C++

Source.cpp contains tests comparing the C++ std::string library with the MyString class
The functions I accounted for are size, length, empty, push_back, pop_back, resize,
find (with a char), rfind (with a char), substr, find (with a substring), and rfind (with a substring)
